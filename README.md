# AlgorithmsWithGraph
Practice different algorithms with graphs


With graph & graph builder class we can read the text in the text files and built the corresponding graph.

There are four different graphs, directed/undirectied X weighted/unweighted.
In the txt file, for each line, the first string stands for the name of source node, 
the second is for destination node, the third (if appears) is for the weight.

With different graphs built base on the txt file(1-1000), realize all kind of algprithms.
Like bfs, dfs, heapify, hashmap, DP, Dijkstra, etc.
