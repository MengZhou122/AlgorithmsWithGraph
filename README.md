# AlgorithmsWithGraph
Practice different algorithms deployed with graphs

With graph & graph builder class we can read the text in the text files and built the corresponding graph.

There are four different graphs, (directed/undirectied X weighted/unweighted).

In the txt file, for each line, the first string stands for the name of source node, the second is for destination node, the third (if appears) is for the weight.

With different graphs built base on the txt file(number of nodes ranges from 1-10000), realize all kinds of related algorithms and data structures.
Like bfs, dfs, heap, hashmap, DP, Dijkstra, Union Find, etc.

In graphtest class, we built several typical test cases for different algorithms and the related assertion were set.
